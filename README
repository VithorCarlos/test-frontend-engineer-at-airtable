- What you like about your implementation.
  I enjoyed it because it covered several important React concepts, including performance, drawing and dropping, and the timeline.

- What you would change if you were going to do it again.
  I'd to change to Typescript, aprimorate the design, create more beatiful component and timeline
- How you made your design decisions. For example, if you looked at other timelines for inspiration, please note that.
  I saw some timelines on Pinterest and i'd to implement that and include images, but the time was too short. I just had 3 hours
- How you would test this if you had more time.
  i'd like to implement unit tests in this project.
